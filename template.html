                    <div class="etc-description">The silicone "blunt bubbler" is a super compact bong for use with joints and blunts; simply fit your joint into it and enjoy smooth, water-cooled hits! There is a high demand for silicone bubblers, and with good reason. It'll change the way you smoke blunts and joints for the rest of your life. It uses an innovative waterpipe-inspired design to cool your hits and allow you to enjoy your smoke with the same smooth ease of a bong hit. Joints and Blunts are great, however they're one of the harshest ways to enjoy your herb, and coughing fits are common enough. If only there were someway to cool down these hits.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3><em>Innovative Modern Design</em></h3> The silicone bubbler is an innovative product in that it takes the basic concept of a bong or glass bubbler and applies it to a compact piece meant to work with your blunt or joint. It stands only a few inches tall, and has a stable base that'll keep it from tipping over when not in use. The silicone bubbler features a modern spill proof design so you don’t have to worry about getting your joints or blunts wet during typical use.
                    <br><br>
						<h3><em>Portable and Made To Last</em></h3>
Made from high quality silicone, the blunt bubbler is capable of withstanding extreme temperatures from -148°F to 572°F. The silicone Bubbler's resilience makes it the perfect worry-free travel piece.  Also, the bubbler is <em>so lightweight</em> and portable that it comes with a pendant loop, so you can wear it around your neck as a functional fashion statement! The exceptional durability of the silicone makes it superior to it's glass counterpart. The carb cap's ergonomic placement allows you to use it naturally with comfort. The aesthetically intelligent design make the silicone blunt bubbler a fantastic piece for anyone looking to augment their smoking experience, and enjoy a cooler, more smooth hit.</div>
